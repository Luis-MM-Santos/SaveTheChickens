//PROJECT

Our first group project at <Code For All_> #104 in Porto's bootcamp challenged us to create a game using the technologies we had learned in the preceding weeks. With just 10 nights to complete it, we aimed to explore every possibility and deliver a functional and engaging game.

//THE IDEA
After an initial brainstorming session, we decided to develop an escape room game, where players must solve unique challenges to find their way out of each room.

//DEVELOPMENT
To ensure smooth collaboration, we created a base room as a shared testing ground, helping us avoid conflicts that could disrupt the game's functionality. Once this foundation was set, we divided tasks among the team so everyone could focus on different room features. As the deadline approached, we regrouped to integrate all components, finalize the game, and polish the details.

//FINAL THOUGHTS
We were proud of what we accomplished in just 10 nights, thanks to everyone's dedication. While the game's graphics and performance could be further refined, we made the most of the Super Simple Graphic Library with only three weeks of programming experience behind us.

Although we couldn't implement all the features we originally envisioned, our team decided to continue working on the game beyond the competition. We're excited to enhance it and incorporate all the elements we initially planned.
